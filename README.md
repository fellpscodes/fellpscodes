**`Appreciator of Programming and Computing (Backend Developer)`**

I’m a Brazilian student passionate about technology and programming. Since I was a kid, I’ve always loved exploring computers and understanding how things work behind the screen. During high school, I discovered my passion for coding, and since then, I’ve been constantly learning and improving my skills.
I’m currently pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development at Universidade Católica de Brasília, focusing on building projects that help me grow as a developer and turn ideas into real solutions.

 <summary><h3> 🎧 My Learning Journey </h3></summary>
  My journey in programming started with curiosity and a strong desire to understand how technology works. Over time, I’ve explored different areas and languages that helped shape my foundation as a developer.
I began learning C++, which taught me the fundamentals of logic and problem-solving, and later expanded my knowledge into front-end development with HTML and CSS.
Currently, my main focus is on Java, where I’m deepening my understanding of object-oriented programming and backend development. I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to keep growing and applying what I’ve learned in real projects.
